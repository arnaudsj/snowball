License for PyStemmer
=====================

PyStemmer is copyright (c) 2006, Richard Boulton

It was inspired by an earlier implementation of PyStemmer (version 0.10, which
was copyright (c) 2001, Andreas Jung, and also licensed under the MIT license,
but no portions of which remain in this package, and had a different API).

Both Andreas Jung's implementation and this implementation are covered by the
following license.

License for sample data files
=============================

There are two files in the "sampledata/" subdirectory, used for benchmarking.
The first of these, "englishvoc.txt", is the english vocabulary list from
snowball, and is covered by the same license as snowball itself (ie, the BSD
license, see above).

The second of these files, "puttydoc.txt", is the text form of the manual for
the "PuTTY" piece of software, which is covered by the following license.

PuTTY is copyright 1997-2006 Simon Tatham.
