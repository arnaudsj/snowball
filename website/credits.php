Snowball, and all of the current stemming algorithms were written by
Dr Martin Porter, who also prepared the material for the Website.
The Snowball to Java codegenerator, and supporting Java libraries, were
contributed by Richard Boulton.
Dr Andrew Macfarlane, of City University, London, gave much
initial encouragement and proofreading
assistance.

</p><p>

The website was established by Richard Boulton, who is still in charge of its
administration.

Linguistic assistance for Russian has been provided by Patrick Miles (of the
Patrick Miles Translation Agency, Cambridge, UK). Pat is a distinguished
translator, whose English versions of Chekhov have appeared on the London
stage.

The website and project hosting is performed by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, to whom our grateful
thanks are due.
