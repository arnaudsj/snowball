Snowball is a language for describing stemming algorithms, primarily for
information retrieval.  Snowball scripts are converted to ANSI C code, which is
then compiled to produce an extremely efficient stemming routine, capable of
stemming upwards of one million words per second on a modern machine (eg, 1 GHz
Pentium III).

</p><p>

Snowball scripts exist for performing stemming a number of European languages,
together with equivalent C programs, stemmer definitions and sample
vocabularies.

</p><p>

Snowball is released as free software under the BSD license, in the hope that
it will be used in as wide a variety of situations as possible.  Developers are
strongly encouraged to submit any and all comments, problem reports and
improvements.
