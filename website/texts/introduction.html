    <B>Summary</B><BR><BR>

    Algorithmic stemmers continue to have great utility in IR, despite the
    promise of out-performance by dictionary-based stemmers. Nevertheless,
    there are few algorithmic descriptions of stemmers, and even when they
    exist they are liable to misinterpretation. Here we look at the ideas
    underlying stemming, and on this website define a language, Snowball,
    in which stemmers can be exactly defined, and from which fast stemmer
    programs in ANSI C or Java can be generated. A range of stemmers is presented
    in parallel algorithmic and Snowball form, including the original
    Porter stemmer for English.
</DL>
<BR><BR>








<BR>&nbsp;<H2>1 Introduction</H2>

There are two main reasons for creating Snowball. One is the lack of
readily available stemming algorithms for languages
other than English. The other is the consciousness of a certain failure on
my part in promoting exact implementations of the stemming
algorithm described in (Porter 1980), which has come to be called the
Porter stemming algorithm. The first point needs some qualification: a
great deal of work has been done on stemmers in a wide range of natural
languages, both in their development and evaluation, (a complete
bibliography cannot be attempted here). But it is rare to see a stemmer
laid out in an unambiguous algorithmic form from which encodings in C,
Java, Perl etc might easily be made. When exact descriptions are
attempted, it is often goes with approaches to stemming that are
relatively simple, for example the Latin stemmer of Schinke (Shinke 1996),
or the Slovene stemmer of Popovic (Popovic 1990). A more complex, and
therefore more characteristic stemmer is the Kraaij-Pohlmann stemmer for
Dutch (Kraaij 1994), which is presented as open source code in ANSI C. To
extract an algorithmic description of their stemmer from the source code
proves to be quite hard.

<BR><BR>

The disparity between the Porter stemmer definition and many of its
purported implementations is much wider than is generally realised in the
IR community. Three problems seem to compound: one is a misunderstanding
of the meaning of the original algorithm, another is bugs in the
encodings, and a third is the the almost irresistible urge of programmers
to add improvements.

For example, a Perl script advertised on the Web as an
implementation of the Porter algorithm was tested in October 2001, and it was
found that 14 percent of words were stemmed incorrectly when given a large sample
vocabulary. Most words of English have
very simple endings, so this means that it was effectively getting everything
wrong. At certain points on the Web are demonstrations of the Porter stemmer.
You type some English into a box and the stemmed words are displayed. These
are frequently faulty. (A good test is to type in <I>agreement</I>. It should stem
to <I>agreement</I> - the same word. If it stems to <I>agreem</I> there is an
error.) Researchers frequently pick up faulty versions of the stemmer and
report that they have applied &#8216;Porter stemming&#8217;, with the result that their
experiments are not quite repeatable. Researchers who work on stemming will
sometimes give incorrect examples of the behaviour of the Porter stemmer in
their published works.

<BR><BR>

To address all these problems I have tried to develop a rigorous system
for defining stemming algorithms. A language, Snowball, has been invented,
in which the rules of stemming algorithms can be expressed in a natural
way. Snowball is quite small, and can be learned by an experienced
programmer in an hour or so. On this website a number of foreign language
stemmers is presented (<I>a</I>) in Snowball, and (<I>b</I>) in a less formal
English-language description. (<I>b</I>) can be thought of as the program
comments for (<I>a</I>). A Snowball compiler translates each Snowball
definition into (<I>c</I>) an equivalent program in ANSI C or Java. Finally (<I>d</I>)
standard vocabularies of words and their stemmed equivalents are provided
for each stemmer. The combination of (<I>a</I>), (<I>b</I>), (<I>c</I>) and (<I>d</I>)
can be used to pin down the definition of a stemmer  exactly, and it is
hoped that Snowball itself will be a useful resource in creating stemmers
in the future.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>2 Some ideas underlying stemming</H2>

Work in stemming has produced a number of different approaches, albeit tied
together by a number of common assumptions. It is worthwhile looking at some
of them to see exactly where Snowball fits into the whole picture.

<BR><BR>

A point tacitly assumed in almost all of the stemming literature is that
stemmers are based upon the written, and not the spoken, form of the
language. This is also the assumption here. Historically,
grammarians often regarded the written language as the real language and
the spoken as a mere derivative form. Almost in reaction, many modern
linguists have taken a precisely opposite view (Farmer, 1965 pp 2-3). A
more balanced position is that the two languages are distinct though
connected, and require separate treatment. One can in fact imagine parallel
stemming algorithms for the spoken language, or rather for the phoneme
sequence into which the spoken language is transformed. Stress and
intonation could be used as clues for an indexing process in the same way
that punctuation and capitalisation are used as clues in the written
language. But currently stemmers work on the written language for the good
reason that there is so much of it available in machine readable form from
which to build our IR systems. Inevitably therefore the stemmers get
caught up in accidental details of orthography. In English, removing the
<B><I>ing</I></B> from <I>rotting</I> should be followed by undoubling the <B><I>tt</I></B>,
whereas in <I>rolling</I> we do not undouble the <B><I>ll</I></B>. In French, removing
the <B><I>er</I></B> from <I>ennuiyer</I> should be followed by changing the <B><I>y</I></B> to
<B><I>i</I></B>, so that the resulting word conflates with <I>ennui</I>, and so on.

<BR><BR>

The idea of stemming is to improve IR performance generally by bringing
under one heading variant forms of a word which share a common meaning.
Harman (1991) was first to present compelling evidence that it may not do
so, when her experiments discovered no significant improvement with the
use of stemming.
Similarly Lennon (1981) discovered no appreciable difference between different
stemmers running on a constant collection.
Later work has modified this position however. Krovetz
(1995) found significant, although sometimes small, improvements across a
range of test collections. What he did discover is that the degree of
improvement varies considerably between different collections.
These tests were however done on collections in
English, and the reasonable assumption of IR researchers has always been that for
languages that are more highly inflected that English (and nearly all
are), greater improvements will be observed when stemming is applied. My
own view is that stemming helps regularise the
vocabulary of an IR system, and this leads to advantages that are not
easily quantifiable through standard IR experiments. For example, it helps
in presenting lists of terms associated with the query back to the IR user
in a relevance feedback cycle, which is one of the underlying ideas of the
probabilistic model. More will be said on the use of a stemmed vocabulary
in section 5.

<BR><BR>

Stemming is not a concept applicable to all languages. It is not, for
example, applicable in Chinese. But to languages of the Indo-European
group, and that group includes the ones looked at here, a common
pattern of word structure does emerge. Assuming words are written left to
right, the stem, or root of a word is on the left, and zero or more
suffixes may be added on the right. If the root is modified by this
process it will normally be at its right hand end. And also prefixes may
be added on the left. So <I>unhappiness</I> has a prefix <B><I>un</I></B>, a suffix
<B><I>ness</I></B>, and the <B><I>y</I></B> of <I>happy</I> has become <B><I>i</I></B> with the addition of
the suffix. Usually, prefixes alter meaning radically, so they are best
left in place (German and Dutch <B><I>ge</I></B> is an exception here). But suffixes
can, in certain circumstances, be removed. So for example <I>happy</I> and
<I>happiness</I> have closely related meanings, and we may wish to stem both
forms to <I>happy</I>, or <I>happi</I>. Infixes can occur, although rarely:
<B><I>ge</I></B> in German and Dutch, and <B><I>zu</I></B> in German.

<BR><BR>

One can make some distinction between <I>root</I> and <I>stem</I>. Lovins (1968)
sees the root as the stem minus any prefixes. But here we will
think of the stem as the residue of the stemming process, and the root as the
inner word from which the stemmed word derives, so we think of root to
some extent in an etymological way. It must be admitted that when you
start thinking hard about these concepts <I>root</I>, <I>stem</I>, <I>suffix</I>,
<I>prefix</I> ... they turn out to be very difficult indeed to define.
Nor do definitions, even if we arrive at them, help us much. After all, suffix
stripping is a practical aid in IR, not an exercise in linguistics or
etymology. This is especially true of the central concept of <I>root</I>. We
think of the etymological root of a word as something we can discover with
certainty from a dictionary, forgetting that etymology itself is a subject
with its own doubts and controversies (Jesperson 1922, Chapter XVI).
Indeed, Jesperson goes so far as to say that

<DL><DD>
    &#8216;It is of course impossible to say how great a proportion of the
    etymologies given in dictionaries should strictly be classed under
    each of the following heads: (1) certain, (2) probable, (3)
    possible, (4) improbable, (5) impossible - but I am afraid the
    first two classes would be the least numerous.&#8217;
</DL>

Here we will simply assume a common sense understanding of
the basic idea of stem and suffix, and hope that this proves sufficient
for designing and discussing stemming algorithms.

<BR><BR>

We can separate suffixes out into three basic classes, which will be
called <I>d</I>-, <I>i</I>- and <I>a</I>-suffixes.

<BR><BR>

An <I>a</I>-suffix, or <I>attached</I> suffix, is a particle word attached to another
word. (In the stemming literature they sometimes get referred to as
&#8216;enclitics&#8217;.) In Italian, for example, personal pronouns attach to
certain verb forms:

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    mandargli    = <TD></TD><TD> mandare + <B><I>gli</I></B>      <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> to send + to him
<TR><TD>    mandarglielo = <TD></TD><TD> mandare + <B><I>gli</I></B> + <B><I>lo</I></B> <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> to send + it + to him
</TABLE></DL>

<I>a</I>-suffixes appear in Italian and Spanish, and also in Portuguese, although
in Portuguese they are separated by hyphen from the preceding word, which
makes them easy to eliminate.

<BR><BR>

An <I>i</I>-suffix, or <I>inflectional</I> suffix, forms part of the basic grammar of a
language, and is applicable to all words of a certain grammatical type,
with perhaps a small number of exceptions. In English for example, the past
of a verb is formed by adding <B><I>ed</I></B>. Certain modifications may be required
in the stem:

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    fit + <B><I>ed</I></B>   <TD></TD><TD> <TT>-&gt;</TT>  <TD></TD><TD> fitted (double <B><I>t</I></B>)
<TR><TD>    love + <B><I>ed</I></B>  <TD></TD><TD> <TT>-&gt;</TT>  <TD></TD><TD> loved (drop the final <B><I>e</I></B> of love)
</TABLE></DL>

but otherwise the rule applies in a regular way to all verbs in
contemporary English, with about 150 (Palmer, 1965) exceptional forms,

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    bear  <TD></TD><TD> beat   <TD></TD><TD> become  <TD></TD><TD> begin  <TD></TD><TD> bend <TD></TD><TD> ....
<TR><TD>    bore  <TD></TD><TD> beat   <TD></TD><TD> became  <TD></TD><TD> began  <TD></TD><TD> bent
</TABLE></DL>

A <I>d</I>-suffix, or <I>derivational</I> suffix, enables a new word, often with a
different grammatical category, or with a different sense, to be built from
another word. Whether a <I>d</I>-suffix can be attached is discovered not from
the rules of grammar, but by referring to a dictionary. So in English,
<B><I>ness</I></B> can be added to certain adjectives to form corresponding nouns
(<I>littleness</I>, <I>kindness</I>, <I>foolishness</I> ...) but not to all adjectives (not for
example, to <I>big</I>, <I>cruel</I>, <I>wise</I> ...) <I>d</I>-suffixes can be used to change
meaning, often in rather exotic ways. So in italian <B><I>astro</I></B> means a sham
form of something else:

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    medico + <B><I>astro</I></B> <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> medicastro    <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> quack doctor
<TR><TD>    poeta + <B><I>astro</I></B>  <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> poetastro     <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> poetaster
</TABLE></DL>

Generally <I>i</I>-suffixes follow <I>d</I>-suffixes. <I>i</I>-suffixes can precede <I>d</I>-suffixes,
for example <I>lovingly</I>, <I>devotedness</I>, but such cases are exceptional. To
be a little more precise, <I>d</I>-suffixes can sometimes be added to
participles. <I>devoted</I>, used adjectivally, is a participle derived from the
verb <I>devote</I>, and <B><I>ly</I></B> can be added to turn the adjective into an adverb,
or <B><I>ness</I></B> to turn it into a noun. The same feature occurs in other
Indo-European languages.

<BR><BR>

Sometimes it is hard to say whether a suffix is a <I>d</I>-suffix or <I>i</I>-suffix,
the comparative and superlative endings <B><I>er</I></B>, <B><I>est</I></B> of English for example.

<BR><BR>

A <I>d</I>-suffix can serve more than one function. In English, for example,
<B><I>ly</I></B> standardly turns an adjective into an adverb (<I>greatly</I>), but it
can also turn a noun into an adjective (<I>kingly</I>). In French, <B><I>ement</I></B>
also standardly turns an adjective into an adverb (<I>grandement</I>), but it
can also turn a verb into a noun (<I>rapprochement</I>). (Referring to the
French stemmer, this double use is ultimately why <B><I>ement</I></B> is tested for
being in the <I>RV</I> rather than the <I>R</I>2 region of the word being
stemmed.)

<BR><BR>

It is quite common for an <I>i</I>-suffix to serve more than one function.
In English, <B><I>s</I></B> can either be (1) a verb ending attached to third person
singular forms (<I>runs</I>, <I>sings</I>), (2) a noun ending indicating the plural
(<I>dogs</I>, <I>cats</I>) or (3) a noun ending indicating the possessive
(<I>boy&#8217;s</I>, <I>girls&#8217;</I>). By an orthographic convention now several hundred
years old, the possessive is written with an apostrophe, but
nowadays this is
frequently omitted in familiar phrases (<I>a girls school</I>). (Usage (3) is
relatively rare compared with (1) and (2): there are only nine uses of
<B><I>&#8217;s</I></B> in this document.)

<BR><BR>



Since the normal order of suffixes is <I>d</I>, <I>i</I> and <I>a</I>, we
can expect them to be removed
from the right in the order <I>a</I>, <I>i</I> and <I>d</I>. Usually we want to remove
all <I>a</I>- and <I>i</I>-suffixes, and some of the <I>d</I>-suffixes.

<BR><BR>

If the stemming process reduces two words to the same stem, they are said
to be <I>conflated</I>.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>3 Stemming errors, and the use of dictionaries</H2>

One way of thinking of the relation between terms and documents in an IR
system is to see the documents as being about concepts, and the terms as
words that describe the concepts. Then, of course, one word can cover many
concepts, so <I>pound</I> can mean a unit of currency, a weight, an enclosure,
or a beating. <I>Pound</I> is a homonym. And one concept can be described by
many words, as with <I>money</I>, <I>capital</I>, <I>cash</I>, <I>currency</I>. These words
are synonyms. There is a many-many mapping therefore between the set of
terms and the set of concepts. Stemming is a process that transforms this
mapping to advantage, on the whole reducing the number of synonyms, but
occasionally creating new homonyms. It is worth remembering that what are
called stemming errors are usually just the introduction of new homonyms into
vocabularies that already contain very large numbers of homonyms.

<BR><BR>

Words which have no place in this term-concept mapping are those which
describe no concepts. The particle words of grammar, <I>the</I>, <I>of</I>,
<I>and</I>
..., known in IR as <I>stopwords</I>, fall into this category. Stopwords can be
useful for retrieval but only in searching for phrases, <I>&#8216;to be or not to
be&#8217;</I>, <I>&#8216;do as you would be done by&#8217;</I> etc. This suggests that stemming
stopwords is not useful. More will be said on stopwords in section 7.

<BR><BR>

In the literature, a distinction is often made between
under-stemming, which is the error of taking off too small a suffix, and
over-stemming, which is the error of taking off too much. In French, for
example, <I>cro&ucirc;tons</I> is the plural of <I>cro&ucirc;ton</I>, &#8216;a crust&#8217;, so to remove
<B><I>ons</I></B> would be over-stemming, while <I>croulons</I> is a verb form of <I>crouler</I>,
&#8216;to totter&#8217;, so to remove <B><I>s</I></B> would be under-stemming. We would like to
introduce a further distinction between mis-stemming and over-stemming.
Mis-stemming is taking off what looks like an ending, but is really part
of the stem. Over-stemming is taking off a true ending which results in
the conflation of words of different meanings.

<BR><BR>

So for example <B><I>ly</I></B> can be removed from <I>cheaply</I>, but not from <I>reply</I>,
because in <I>reply</I> <B><I>ly</I></B> is not a suffix. If it was removed, <I>reply</I> would
conflate with <I>rep</I>, (the commonly used short form of <I>representative</I>).
Here we have a case of mis-stemming.

<BR><BR>

To illustrate over-stemming, look at these four words,

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>                  <TD></TD><TD>  <B>verb</B>     <TD></TD><TD>   <B>adjective</B>

<TR><TD>    First pair:   <TD></TD><TD>  prove   <TD></TD><TD>    provable
<TR><TD>    Second pair:  <TD></TD><TD>  probe   <TD></TD><TD>    probable
</TABLE></DL>

Morphologically, the two pairs are exactly parallel (in the written, if not
the spoken language). They also have a common etymology. All four words
derive from the Latin <I>probare</I>, &#8216;to prove or to test&#8217;, and the idea of
testing connects the meanings of the words. But the meanings are not parallel.
<I>provable</I> means &#8216;able to be proved&#8217;; <I>probable</I> does not mean &#8216;able to be
probed&#8217;. Most people would judge conflation of the first pair as correct,
and of the second pair, incorrect. In other words, to remove <B><I>able</I></B> from
<I>probable</I> is a case of over-stemming.

<BR><BR>

We can try to avoid mis-stemming and over-stemming by using a dictionary.
The dictionary can tell us that <I>reply</I> does not derive from <I>rep</I>, and
that the meanings of <I>probe</I> and <I>probable</I> are well separated in modern
English. It is important to realise however that a dictionary does not give
a complete solution here, but can be a tool to improve the conflation
process.

<BR><BR>

In Krovetz&#8217;s dictionary experiments (Krovetz 1995), he noted that in
looking up a past participle like <I>suited</I>, one is led either to <I>suit</I> or
to <I>suite</I> as plausible infinitive forms. <I>suite</I> can be rejected,
however, because the dictionary tells us that
although it is a word of English
it is not a verb form. Cases
like this (and Krovetz found about 60) had to be treated as exceptions. But
the form <I>routed</I> could
either derive from the the verb <I>rout</I> or the verb <I>route</I>:

<DL><DD>
    At Waterloo Napoleon&#8217;s forces were routed<BR>
    The cars were routed off the motorway
</DL>

Such cases in English are extremely rare, but they are commoner in more
highly inflected languages. In French for example, <I>affiliez</I> can either be
the verb <I>affiler</I>, to sharpen, with imperfect ending <B><I>iez</I></B>, or the verb
<I>affilier</I>, to affiliate, with present indicative ending <B><I>ez</I></B>:

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    vous affiliez <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> vous affil-iez <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> you sharpened
<TR><TD>    vous affiliez <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> vous affili-ez <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> you affiliate
</TABLE></DL>

If the second is intended, removal of <B><I>iez</I></B> is mis-stemming.

<BR><BR>

With over-stemming we must rely upon the dictionary to separate meanings.
There are different ways of doing this, but all involve some degree of
reliance upon the lexicographers. Krovetz&#8217;s methods are no doubt best,
because the most objective: he uses several measures, but they are based on
the idea of measuring the similarity in
meaning of two words by the degree of overlap among the words used to define
them, and this is at a good remove from a lexicographer&#8217;s subjective
judgement about semantic similarity.

<BR><BR>

There is an interesting difference between mis-stemming and over-stemming
to do with language history. The morphology of a language changes less
rapidly than the meanings of the words in it. When extended to include a
few archaic endings, such as <B><I>ick</I></B> as an alternative to <B><I>ic</I></B>, a stemmer for
contemporary English can be applied to the English of 300 years ago.
Mis-stemmings will be roughly the same, but the pattern of over-stemming will
be different because of the changing meaning of words in the language. For
example, <I>relativity</I> in the 19th century merely meant &#8216;the condition of
being relative to&#8217;. With that meaning, it is acceptable to conflate it
with <I>relative</I>.
But with the 20th century meaning brought to it by
Einstein, stemming to <I>relativ</I> is over-stemming.
Here we see the word with the suffix changing its meaning, but it can happen
the other way round. <I>transpire</I> has come to mean &#8216;happen&#8217;, and its old
meaning of &#8217;exhalation&#8217; or &#8216;breathing out&#8217; is now effectively lost.
(That is the bitter reality, although dictionaries still try to persuade us
otherwise). But <I>transpiration</I> still carries the earlier meaning.
So what was formerly an acceptable stemming may be judged now as
an over-stemming, not because the word being stemmed had changed its meaning,
but because some cognate word has changed its meaning.

<BR><BR>

In these examples we are presenting words as if they had single meanings, but
the true picture is more complicated. Krovetz uses a model of word
meanings which is extremely helpful here. He makes a distinction between
<I>homonyms</I> and <I>polysemes</I>. The meaning of homonyms are quite unrelated.
For example, <I>ground</I> in the sense of &#8216;earth&#8217;, and &#8216;ground&#8217; as the past
participle of &#8216;grind&#8217; are homonyms. Etymologically homonyms have different
stories, and they usually have separate entries in a dictionary. But each
homonym form can have a range of polysemic forms, corresponding to different
shades of meaning. So <I>ground</I> can mean the earth&#8217;s surface, or the bottom
of the sea, or soil, or any base, and so the basis of an argument, and so on.
Over time new polysemes appear and old ones die. At any moment, the use of a
word will be common in some polysemic forms and rare in others. If a suffix is
attached to a word the new word will get a different set of polysemes. For
example, <I>grounds</I> = <I>ground</I> + <B><I>s</I></B> acquires the sense of &#8216;dregs&#8217; and
&#8216;estate lands&#8217;, loses the sense of &#8216;earth&#8217;, and shares the sense of
&#8216;basis&#8217;.


Consider the conflation of <I>mobility</I> with <I>mobile</I>. <I>mobile</I> has
acquired two new polysemes not shared with <I>mobility</I>. One is the &#8216;mobile
art object&#8217;, common in the nursery. This arrived in the 1960s, and is
still in use. The other is the &#8216;mobile phone&#8217; which is now very dominant,
although it may decline in the future when it has replaced by some new
gadget with a different name. We might draw a graph of the degree of
separation of the meanings of <I>mobility</I> and <I>mobile</I> against time,
which would depend upon the number of polysemes and the intensity of their
use. What seemed like a valid conflation of the two words in 1940 may seem
to be invalid today.

<BR><BR>

In general therefore one can say that judgements about whether words are
over-stemmed change with time as the meanings of words in the language
change.

<BR><BR>

The use of a dictionary should reduce errors of mis-stemming and errors of
over-stemming. And, for English at least, the mis-stemming errors should
reduce well, even if there are problems with over-stemming errors. Of
course, it depends on the quality of the dictionary. A dictionary will need
to be very comprehensive, fully up-to-date, and with good word definitions
to achieve the best results.

<BR><BR>

Historically, stemmers have often been thought of as either
dictionary-based or algorithmic. The presentation of studies of stemming
in the literature has perhaps helped to create this division. In the
Lovins&#8217; stemmer the algorithmic description is central. In accounts of
dictionary-based stemmers the emphasis tends to be on dictionary content
and structure, and IR effectiveness. Savoy&#8217;s French stemmer (Savoy, 1993)
is a good example of this. But the two approaches are not really distinct.
An algorithmic stemmer can include long exception lists that are
effectively mini-dictionaries, and a dictionary-based stemmer usually
needs a process for removing at least <I>i</I>-suffixes to make the look-up
in the dictionary possible. In fact in a language in which proper names
are inflected (Latin, Finnish, Russian ...), a dictionary-based stemmer
will need to remove <I>i</I>-suffixes independently of dictionary look-up,
because the proper names will not of course be in the dictionary.

<BR><BR>

The stemmers available on the Snowball website are all purely
algorithmic. They can be extended to include built-in exception lists, they
could be used in combination with a full dictionary, but they are still
presented here in their simplest possible form. Being purely algorithmic,
they are, or ought to be, inferior to the performance of well-constucted
dictionary-based stemmers. But they are still very useful, for the
following reasons:

<BR><BR>

1) Algorithmic stemmers are (or can be made) very lean and very fast. The
stemmers presented here generate code that will process about a million
words in six seconds on a conventional 500MHz PC. Nowadays we can generate
very large IR systems with quite modest resources, and tools that assist in
this have value.

<BR><BR>

2) Despite the errors they can be seen to make, algorithmic stemmers still
give good practical results. As Krovetz (1995) says in surprise of the
algorithmic stemmer, &#8216;Why does it do so well?&#8217; (page 89).

<BR><BR>

3) Dictionary-based stemmers require dictionary maintenance, to keep up
with an ever-changing language, and this is actually quite a problem. It
is not just that a dictionary created to assist stemming today will
probably require major updating in a few years time, but that a dictionary
in use for this purpose today may already be several years out of date.

<BR><BR>

We can hazard an answer to Krovetz&#8217;s question, as to why algorithmic
stemmers perform as well as they do, when they reveal so many cases of
under-, over- and mis-stemming. Under-stemming is a fault, but by itself
it will not degrade the performance of an IR system. Because of
under-stemming words may fail
to conflate that ought to have conflated, but you are, in a sense, no
worse off than you were before. Mis-stemming is more serious, but again
mis-stemming does not really matter unless it leads to false conflations,
and that frequently does not happen. For example, removing the <B><I>ate</I></B>
ending in English, can result in useful conflations (<I>luxury</I>,
<I>luxuriate</I>; <I>affection</I>, <I>affectionate</I>), but very often produces
stems that are not English words
(<I>enerv-ate</I>, <I>accommod-ate</I>,
<I>deliber-ate</I> etc). In the literature, these are normally
classed as stemming errors - overstemming - although in our nomenclature
they are examples of mis-stemming.
However these residual stems,
<I>enerv</I>, <I>accommod</I>,
<I>deliber</I> ... do not conflate with other word forms, and so behave in
an IR system in the same way as if they still retained their <B><I>ate</I></B>
ending. No false conflations arise, and so there is no over-stemming here.

<BR><BR>

To summarise, one can say that just as a word can be over-stemmed
but not mis-stemmed (<I>relativity</I> <TT>-&gt;</TT> <I>relative</I>), so it can be
mis-stemmed but not over-stemmed (<I>enervate</I> <TT>-&gt;</TT> <I>enerv</I>). And, of
course, even over-stemming does not matter, if the over-stemmed word falsely
conflates with other words that exist in the language, but are not
encountered in the IR
system which is being used.

<BR><BR>

Of the three types of error,
over-stemming is the most important, and
using a dictionary does not elimiate all over-stemmings, but does reduce their
incidence.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>4 Stemming as part of an indexing process</H2>

Stemming is part of a composite process of extracting words from text and
turning them into index terms in an IR system. Because stemming is somewhat
complex and specialised, it is usually studied in isolation. Even so, it
cannot really be separated from other aspect of the indexing process:

<BR><BR>

1) What is a word? For indexing purposes, a word in a European language is
a sequence of letters bounded by non-letters. But in English, an internal
apostrophe does not split a word, although it is not classed as a letter.
The treatment of these word boundary characters affects the stemmer. For
example, the Kraaij Pohlmann stemmer for Dutch (Kraaij, 1994, 1995) removes hyphen and
treats apostrophe as part of the alphabet (so <B><I>&#8217;s</I></B>, <B><I>&#8217;tje</I></B> and <B><I>&#8217;je</I></B> are three
of their endings). The Dutch stemmer presented here assumes hyphen and
apostrophe have already been removed from the word to be stemmed.

<BR><BR>

2) What is a letter? Clearly letters define words, but different languages
use different letters, much confusion coming from the varied use of
accented Roman letters.

<BR><BR>

English speakers, perhaps influenced by the ASCII character set, typically regard
their alphabet of <B><I>a</I></B> to <B><I>z</I></B> as the norm, and other forms (for example, Danish
<B><I>&aring;</I></B> and <B><I>&oslash;</I></B>, or German <B><I>&szlig;</I></B>) as somewhat abnormal. But this is
an insular point of view. In Italian, for example, the letters
<B><I>j</I></B>, <B><I>k</I></B>, <B><I>w</I></B>, <B><I>x</I></B> and <B><I>y</I></B> are not part of the alphabet, and are
only seen in foreign words. We also tend to regard other alphabets as only
used for isolated languages, and that is not strictly true. Cyrillic is
used for a range of languages other than Russian, among which additional
letters and accented forms abound.

<BR><BR>

In English, a broad definition of letter would be anything that could be
accepted as a pronouncable element of a word. This would include
accented Roman letters (<I>na<B><I>&iuml;</I></B>ve</I>, <I>Faur<B><I>&eacute;</I></B></I>), and certain ligature
forms (<I>encyclop<B><I>&aelig;</I></B>dia</I>). It would exclude letters
of foreign alphabets, such as Greek and Cyrillic.
The <B><I>a</I></B> to <B><I>z</I></B> alphabet is one of those where letters come in
two styles, upper and lower case, which historically correspond (very roughly) to the
shapes you get if you use a chisel or a pen. Across all languages, the
exact relation of upper to lower case is not so easy to define. In Italian,
for example, an accented lower case letter is sometimes represented in
upper case by an the unaccented letter followed by an apostrophe. (I have
seen this convention used in modern Italian news stories in machine
readable form.)

<BR><BR>

In fact the Porter stemmer (which is for English) assumes the word being stemmed is
unaccented and in lower case. More exactly, <B><I>a</I></B>, <B><I>e</I></B>, <B><I>i</I></B>, <B><I>o</I></B>,
<B><I>u</I></B>,
and sometimes <B><I>y</I></B>, are
treated as vowels, and any other character gets treated as a consonant.
Each stemmer presented here assumes some degree of normalisation before it
receives the word, which is roughly (<I>a</I>) put all letters into lower case,
and (<I>b</I>) remove accents from letter-accent combinations that do not form
part of the alphabet of the language. Each stemmer declares the
letter-accent combinations for its language, and this can be used as a
guide for the normalisation, but even so, we can see from
the discussion above that (<I>a</I>) and (<I>b</I>) are not trivial
operations, and need to be done with care.

<BR><BR>

(Incidentally, because the stemmers work on lower case words, turning
letters to upper case is sometimes used internally for flagging purposes.)

<BR><BR>

3) Identifying stopwords. Invariant stopwords are more easily found before
stemming is applied, but inflecting stopwords (for example, German <I>kein</I>, <I>keine</I>, <I>keinem</I>,
<I>keinen</I> ... ) may be easier to find after - because there are fewer forms.
There is a case for building stopword identification into the stemming
process. See section 7.

<BR><BR>

4) Conflating irregular forms. More will be said on this in section 6.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>5 The use of stemmed words</H2>

The idea of how stemmed words might be employed in an IR system has
evolved slightly over the years. The Lovins stemmer (Lovins 1968) was
developed not for indexing document texts, but the subject terms attached
to them. With queries stemmed in the same way, the user needed no special
knowledge of the form of the subject terms. Rijsbergen (1979, Chapter 2)
assumes document text analysis: stopwords are removed, the remaining words
are stemmed, and the resulting set of stemmed word constitute the IR index
(and this style of use is widespread today). More flexibility however is
obtained by indexing <I>all</I> words in a text in an unstemmed form, and
keeping a separate two-column relation which connects the words to their
stemmed equivalents. The relation can be denoted by <I>R(s, w)</I>, which means
that <I>s</I> is the stemmed form of word <I>w</I>. From the relation we can get, for
any word <I>w</I>, its unique stemmed form, <I>stem(w)</I>, and for any stem <I>s</I>, the set
of words, <I>words(s)</I>, that stem to <I>s</I>.

<BR><BR>

The user should not have to see the stemmed form of a word. If a list of
stems is to be presented back for query expansion, in place of
a stem, <I>s</I>, the user should be shown a single representative from the set
<I>words(s)</I>, the one of highest frequency perhaps. The user should also
be able to choose for the whole query, or at a lower level for each word
in a query, whether or not it should be stemmed. In the absence of such
choices, the system can make its own
decisions.
perhaps single word queries would not undergo
stemming; long queries would; stopwords would be removed
except in phrases. In query expansion, the system would work with stemmed
forms, ignoring stopwords.

<BR><BR>

Query expansion with stemming results in a much cleaner vocabulary list
than without, and this is a main strength of using a stemming process.

<BR><BR>

A question arises: if the user never sees the stemmed form, does its
appearance matter? The answer must be no, although
the Porter stemmer tries to make the unstemmed forms guessable from the stemmed
forms. For example, from <I>appropri</I> you can guess <I>appropriate</I>. At least,
trying to achieve this effect acts as a useful control. Similarly with the
other stemmers presented here, an attempt has been made to keep the
appearance of the stemmed forms as familiar as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;<H2>6 Irregular grammatical forms</H2>

All languages contain irregularities, but to what extent should they be
accommodated in a stemming algorithm? An English stemmer, for example, can
convert regular plurals to singular form without difficulty (<I>boys</I>, <I>girls</I>,
<I>hands</I> ...). Should it do the same with irregular plurals (<I>men</I>, <I>children</I>,
<I>feet</I>, ...)? Here we have irregular cases with <I>i</I>-suffixes, but there are
irregularities with <I>d</I>-suffixes, which Lovins calls &#8216;spelling exceptions&#8217;.
<I>absorb/absorption</I> and <I>conceive/conception</I> are examples of this.
Etymologically, the explanation of the first is that the Latin root,
<I>sorbere</I>, is an irregular verb, and of the second that the word
<I>conceive</I> comes to us from the French rather than straight from the Latin.
It is interesting that, even with no knowledge of the etymology, we do
recognise the connection between the words.

<BR><BR>

Lovins tries to solve spelling exceptions by formulating general respelling
rules (turn <B><I>rpt</I></B> into <B><I>rb</I></B> for example), but it might be easier to have
simply a list of exceptional stems.

<BR><BR>

The Porter stemmer does not handle irregularities at all, but from the
author&#8217;s own experience, this has never been an area of complaint.
Complaints in fact are always about false conflations, for example <I>new</I>
and <I>news</I>.

<BR><BR>

Possibly Lovins was right in wanting to resolve <I>d</I>-suffix irregularities,
and not being concerned about <I>i</I>-suffix irregularities. <I>i</I>-suffix
irregularities in English go with short, old words, that are either in very
common use (<I>man/men</I>, <I>woman/women</I>, <I>see/saw</I> ...) or are used only rarely
(<I>ox/oxen</I>, <I>louse/lice</I>, <I>forsake/forsook</I> ...). The latter class can be
ignored, and the former has its own problems which are not always solved
by stemming. For example <I>man</I> is a verb, and <I>saw</I> can mean a cutting
instrument, or, as a verb, can mean to use such an instrument. Conflation
of these forms frequently leads to an error like mis-stemming therefore.

<BR><BR>

An algorithmic stemmer really needs holes where the irregular forms can be
plugged in as necessary. This is more serviceable than attempting to
embed special lists of these irregular forms into software.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>7 Stopwords</H2>

We have suggested that stemming stopwords is not useful. There is a
grammatical connection between <I>being</I> and <I>be</I>, but conflation of the two
forms has little use in IR because they have no shared meaning that would
entitle us to think of them as synonyms. <I>being</I> and <I>be</I> have a
morphological connection as well, but that is not true of <I>am</I> and <I>was</I>,
although they have a grammatical connection. Generally speaking,
inflectional stopwords exhibit many irregularities, which means that
stemming is not only not useful, but not possible, unless one builds into
the stemmer tables of exceptions.

<BR><BR>

Switching from English to French, consider <I>&ecirc;tre</I>, the equivalent form
of <I>be</I>. It has about 40 different forms, including,

<DL><DD>
  <B><I>suis  &nbsp;  es  &nbsp;  sommes  &nbsp;  serez  &nbsp;  &eacute;taient  &nbsp;  fus  &nbsp;  furent  &nbsp;  sois  &nbsp;  &eacute;t&eacute;</I></B>
</DL>

(and <I>suis</I> incidentally is a homonym, as part of the verb <I>suivre</I>.)
Passing all forms through a rule-based stemmer creates something of a
mess. An alternative approach is to recognise this group of words, and
other groups, and take special action. The recognition could take place
inside the stemmer, or be done before the stemmer is called. One special
action would be to stem (perhaps one should say &#8216;map&#8217;) all the forms to a
standard form, ETRE, to indicate that they are parts of the verb <I>&ecirc;tre</I>.
Deciding what to do with the term ETRE, and it would probably be to
discard it, would be done outside the stemming process. Another special
action would be to recognize a whole class of stopwords and simply discard
them.

<BR><BR>

The strategy adopted will depend upon the underlying IR model, so what one
needs is the flexibility to create modified forms of a standard stemmer.
Usually we present Snowball stemmers in their unadorned form. Thereafter,
the addition of stopword tables is quite easy.


<BR>&nbsp;<H2>8 Rare forms</H2>

Stemmers do not need to handle linguistic forms that turn up only very
rarely, but in practice it is hard to design a stemmer with all rare forms
eliminated without there apprearing to be some gaps in the thinking. For
this reason one should not worry too much about their occasional presence.
For example, in contemporary Portuguese, use of the second person plural
form of verbs has almost completely disappeared. Even so, endings for
those forms are included in the Portuguese stemmer. They appear in all the
grammar books, and will in any case be found in older texts. The habit of
putting in rare forms to &#8216;complete the picture&#8217; is well established, and
usually passes unnoticed. An example is the list of English stopwords in
van Rijsbergen (1979). This includes <I>yourselves</I>, by analogy with
<I>himself</I>, <I>herself</I> etc., although <I>yourselves</I> is actually quite a rare
word in English.
