You can use this site at a number of levels:

<BR><BR>

- You can look at the stemming algorithm definitions themselves, and use
them as templates for coding your own versions of stemmers in the computer
language of your choice.

<BR><BR>

- You can use the various ANSI C stemmers, without bothering yourself
with the Snowball system that generated them. To do that, download the
Snowball system, and extract the following &nbsp;<TT>*.h</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>*.c</TT>&nbsp; files
from directory &nbsp;<TT>q/</TT>:

<BR><PRE>
    header.h    utilities.c
    api.h       api.c
</PRE>



They
provide the library and api connections to the stemmers. For each language
stemmer you want to use, download the corresponding &nbsp;<TT>.c</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>.h</TT>&nbsp; file.
Then follow the

    <A HREF="../q/use.html"> instructions for use</A>.

<BR><BR>

For an even faster route, see the <B>Quick start</B> for Snowball, below.

<BR><BR>

- You can get involved in Snowball itself. This is particularly worthwhile
if you want to adjust the stemmers or develop new stemmers. A typical reason
for adjusting the stemmers is that you are working with a different encoding
of accented letters from the ISO Latin I encoding assumed in most of the scripts
here. Then you need to make your own version of the Snowball compiler and
work with the Snowball scripts.

<DL><DD>

Snowball is a language in which stemming algorithms can be easily
represented. The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball script (a &nbsp;<TT>.sbl</TT>
file) into a thread-safe ANSI C module and its corresponding header file
(a &nbsp;<TT>.c</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>.h</TT>&nbsp; file). The language has a full

    <A HREF="../p/snowman.html"> manual</A>,

and the various stemming scripts act as example programs.

</DL>

- You can get deeply interested in stemming. If you do, read the

    <A HREF="../texts/introduction.html"> introductory paper</A>

about Snowball. It is a bit heavyweight, but provides essential background.
And look at the

    <A HREF="../texts/howtohelp.html"> notes</A>

on how you can help.

<BR>&nbsp;<H2>Quick Start</H2>

To get something working quickly, use &nbsp;<TT>gcc</TT>&nbsp; with the following
modules from dowloaded directory &nbsp;<TT>q/</TT>:

<BR><PRE>
    gcc -o STEMMER q/api.c q/utilities.c q/driver-porter.c q/stem.c
</PRE>

<TT>STEMMER</TT>&nbsp; runs the Porter stemming algorithm. See the start of
<TT>q/driver-porter.c</TT>&nbsp; for a simple spec of the command.

<BR><BR>

For the French stemmer, replace &nbsp;<TT>q/stem.c</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>q/stem.h</TT>&nbsp; with
<TT>french/stem.c</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>french/stem.h</TT>, change &nbsp;<TT>porter</TT>&nbsp; to &nbsp;<TT>french</TT>
throughout &nbsp;<TT>q/driver-porter.c</TT>&nbsp; and recompile. Similarly for other languages.
<TT>q/driver.template</TT>&nbsp; provides a template driver that you can adjust language by
language.
