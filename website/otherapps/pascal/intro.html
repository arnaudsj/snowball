 Dear Mr. Porter,

 Somebody extended Snowball for me to create Pascal stemmers. I wanted the
 stemming algorithms in Pascal so they can be compiled in my information
 retrieval system (http://www.collectionconnection.nl) which is created in
 Delphi. I would not mind sharing the extensions, especially given the nature
 of the Snowball project. If you are interested, please let me know, and I
 will send you the sources. Everything seems to be working fine, but
 unfortunately I won't be able to maintain the Pascal-extension code when the
 core Snowball program changes since my knowledge of C is approximately zero.
 Here are the changes the developer made:

 "In order to support Delphi files generation I've added file
 generator_delphi.c (in compiler directory). Also modified:
 1) header.h: added output_delphi and make_delphi fields to struct options.
 Also added forward declarations to Delphi's generator functions;
 2) driver.c: modified in order to support new command line option "-d" and
 call Delphi generator if its specified;

 Modified GNUmakefile at the root of the snowball tree in order to add
 generator_delphi.c into the compilation process.

 Folder Delphi added. It contains 3 files:
 1) SnowballProgram.pas - base class for all generated stemmers;
 2) Test.bpr - template for the sample projects;
 3) Generate.pl - Perl script that generate all sample stemmers.

 File algorithms/finnish/stem.sbl modified. There was two grouping: v and V. I
 rename V to V2 because Delphi Language is case-insensitive."

 I appologize for emailing you directly, but offering the source code on the
 mailing list could result in parallel versions instead of a single CVS
 version and I didn't think that would be good either.

 Best regards,
 Wout van Wezel

 Wout,

 Thank you for this email. I am very busy with a number of other things at the
 moment, but hope to send you a sensible reply in a few days. Meanwhile I'm
 copying your email to Richard Boulton, who is equally involved with the
 Snowball work.

 Martin

 Wout,

 I think it would be a shame to lose the work you have done, but at the moment
 I'm not sure about the best way to make it publicly available from the Snowball
 site. I will talk the matter over with Richard Boulton. Could I suggest that,
 despite your misgivings, it should be announced on Snowball discuss? We then
 get a record on the site that Pascal versions of the stemmers do exist.

 Maintenance is of course the main issue here. On
 http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer I have about 14 versions of the
 Porter stemmer in various languages, only four of which I wrote myself.
 Inevitably I get queries about versions of the stemmer written in programming
 languages I am not familiar with, and they are difficult to answer, especially
 when contact with the author has been lost.

 We would need to assess the code. For example,

 >File algorithms/finnish/stem.sbl modified. There was two grouping: v and V. I
 >rename V to V2 because Delphi Language is case-insensitive."

 This is not a good solution, since it constrains the writing of Snowball
 scripts. The name translation should reflect case. There are various ways of
 doing this, for example,

 stemmer -> stemmer_lllllll
 Stemmer -> stemmer_ullllll
 STEMMER -> stemmer_uuuuuuu

 where the pattern of u's an l's shows the upper/lower case usage of the
 original name.

 Dear Martin/Richard,

 I've attached the files I got from the developer. The changed sources are in
 the Snowball tree. The developer has explained in 'readme.doc' what he did.
 Be aware that I don't have an understanding of the Snowball or C language
 myself. If you think it would be usefull for a more general audience, I can
 ask the developer to work on the 'case' problem.

 ps, I don't mind a message on the discussion list. Also, I would be happy to
 send the Pascal stemmers or the adapted Snowball program to people from the
 list that think they could use it.

 Best regards,
 Wout

 Wout,

 I have only recently looked through the the large tgz file you sent me in
 January. Here are some initial thoughts,

 The work of your student was done to high standard, and the delivered system,
 with software enxtensions and documentation, is very nice. The only real slip
 is that the upper/lower case disctinction of Snowball  names was not preserved
 in the generated Pascal code. But I have altered the finnish stemmer so that V
 and v are called V2 and V1 now, so you won't have to create a separate version.

 I have not yet talked to Richard Boulton about this, but I think we should keep
 the tgz file on the Snowball site with a note about its purpose, but I don't
 think it is worth incorporating the Pascal codegenerator into the main Snowball
 system, since it is unlikely there would be a large demand for Pascal versions
 of the stemmers.

 There is of course a danger that as Snowball extends, use of the Pascal
 codegenerator will become increasingly difficult, but I am beginning to think
 that Snowball is now fairly fixed, so that should not be a problem.

 Martin
