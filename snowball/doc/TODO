Things to do:

 - Write documentation for how to use libstemmer (as opposed to how stemming
   algorithms themselves work).
 - Support a range of character sets.  Alternatively, use UTF-8 as the standard
   character set for algorithms, and require applications to convert to UTF-8.

Things that would be nice to include at some point.

 - Add version numbers to each stemming algorithm, and allow the interface to
   request a specific version of the stemming algorithms.  Default to providing
   the latest version of the algorithm.
