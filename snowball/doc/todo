Various parts of the api for libstemmer need fixing:

    * calls to get a version number for each algorithm.
    * possibly, ask for a given version, and get null if not available.
    * sort out unicode issues (should accept utf-8 input, use 16 bit
      characters internally?)

Documentation of the build process needs to be written.

Code checking tools need to be applied to the generated stemmers.
