libstemmer_c
============

This document pertains to the C version of the libstemmer distribution,
available for download from:

http://snowball.tartarus.org/dist/libstemmer_c.tgz


Compiling the library
=====================

A simple makefile is provided for Unix style systems.  On such systems, it
should be possible simply to run "make", and the file "libstemmer.o"
and the example program "stemwords" will be generated.

If this doesn't work on your system, you need to write your own build
system (or call the compiler directly).  The files to compile are
all contained in the "libstemmer", "runtime" and "src_c" directories,
and the public header file is contained in the "include" directory.


Using the library
=================

The library provides a simple C API.  Essentially, a new stemmer can
be obtained by using "sb_stemmer_new".  "sb_stemmer_stem" is then
used to stem a word, "sb_stemmer_length" returns the stemmed
length of the last word processed, and "sb_stemmer_delete" is
used to delete a stemmer.

Creating a stemmer is a relatively expensive operation - the expected
usage pattern is that a new stemmer is created when needed, used
to stem many words, and deleted after some time.

Stemmers are re-entrant, but not threadsafe.  In other words, if
you wish to access the same stemmer object from multiple threads,
you must ensure that all access is protected by a mutex or similar
device.

libstemmer does not currently incorporate any mechanism for caching the results
of stemming operations.  Such caching can greatly increase the performance of a
stemmer under certain situations, so suitable patches will be considered for
inclusion.


The stemwords example
=====================

The stemwords example program allows you to run any of the stemmers
compiled into the libstemmer library on a sample vocabulary.  For
details on how to use it, run it with the "-h" command line option.


Using the library in a larger system
====================================

If you are incorporating the library into the build system of a larger
program, I recommend copying the unpacked tarball without modification into
a subdirectory of the sources of your program.  Future versions of the
library are intended to keep the same structure, so this will keep the
work required to move to a new version of the library to a minimum.

As an additional convenience, the list of source and header files used
in the library is detailed in mkinc.mak - a file which is in a suitable
format for inclusion by a Makefile.  By including this file in your build
system, you can link the snowball system into your program with a few
extra rules.
