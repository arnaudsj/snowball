Things to do before this module can become the official code module for the
snowball project.

 - Modify build system to include building of the Java stemmers.
 - Write documentation for how to use libstemmer (as opposed to how stemming
   algorithms themselves work).
 - Modify the website module so that it doesn't contain the code.  The website
   module should just contain the HTML for the website, and possibly some
   tarballs containing data.  A script will be required to build the website,
   by copying or building all the files which contain code, or which are
   derived from code.

Things that would be nice to include at some point.

 - Add version numbers to each stemming algorithm, and allow the interface to
   request a specific version of the stemming algorithms.  Default to providing
   the latest version of the algorithm.
 - Support a range of character sets.  Alternatively, use UTF-8 as the standard
   character set for algorithms, and require applications to convert to UTF-8.
